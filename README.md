<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The main goal of this programming Health eat project is to create an Gui application that contains a file and where the user can add his data to this file. Our idea was to create something that could help the user to be healther and to get more informed about what he eats.



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

As you can see there are different python file for this project to work:
- Main_code.py which contains the main code with the whole application
- functions.py which contains the code that allows us to add and read the file
- Products.txt which is the data
- logo.jpeg which is the image in the Giu application




### Installation

1. Run the functions.py
2. Run the Main_code.py (do not forget to install the packages first)

## Usage

This Gui application will first ask you to register. Once you are registered it will automatically redirect you to the login page where you will need to sign in again.
After, you did this, you will have three options:
1) Calculator: this button will allow to calculate the number of calories, protein, fat, carbs of the product you inserted,
2) Add a Product: this button will allow you insert an alliment to the file (unfortinatelly it does not work for some reasons)
3) BMI calculator: this button will ask you to insert your weight and height to calculate your current BMI.
